      <h4 class="paperheading">Cavalry</h5>
      <p>Maybe the most renowned and famous cavalry in those times was the Macedonian Companion Cavalry. They were considered the finest cavalry among the Greeks and were arguably the most valuable units within the army. Sources state that the army contained from 4,000 to over 5,000 total cavalry units and around 1,800 to 2,000 of those were companion cavalry. What was new for the time was that the companion Cavalry was specialized at attacking the enemy flanks, effectively dismantling the formation from the inside out. Also, the tactic they used was new for the time. They formed a wedge with the leader at the tip and they pretty much cut into the enemy lines right down the middle. Other parts of the cavalry included the Thessalian Cavalry which was also considered to be one of the finest Greek cavalries. Their role was more defensive as opposed to the Companion Cavalry’s offensive style. They stood back and protected the flank because the Phalanx’s of the time were extremely susceptible to flanks from the sides and rear.

      <h4 class="paperheading">Infantry</h5>
      <p>The main component of the Macedonian infantry were the foot companions. They were essentially the main heavy infantry that composed the bulk of the army. This improved military unit was akin to the famous Phalanx that swept the Greek military tide for the past couple hundred years. However, this unit was modified to be better than the regular phalanx because of the length of the spears. The length of the spears was sometimes double the length of a regular Greek phalanx spear and that allowed them to reach the enemy before the enemy’s spear did. However, an offset to that advantage was that the spears were harder to wield and even harder for the soldiers to be trained with them. A solution was brought by reducing the size of the shield so that it could be easily held by one hand and then the spear could be then held with both hands. With this improved unit Macedonia was able to secure its borders with ease when fighting with other Greek armies.
      </p>
    <p>The other part of the infantry was the light infantry including archers and the Hypaspists. These were the elite infantrymen and are described to be lighter equipped than the foot companions. They were faster and consequently went ahead of the heavy infantry on marches. Alexander used them mainly to protect the flanks since they were equipped as skirmishers. However, when the Macedonian army fought battles where the foot companions struggled, the Hypaspists would fulfill those roles.

    <h4 class="paperheading">Mercenaries and Allies</h5>
    <p>The Macedonian army used forces from neighboring Greek city states as well as hiring mercenaries from surrounding barbarian civilizations. The most important ally unit was the Thessalian Cavalry that was mentioned above. Other units from the Greek city states includes Archers from Crete which were considered to be very effective since archery required a lot of training which most Greek city states were not equipped to give. Another unit were the Peltasts. These were light infantry units that had a smaller shield and were equipped with almost no armor. Most of the mercenaries were classified under this unit type. Finally, Alexander employed many barbarian units from the places he conquered. These units consisted of Arachosian, Bactrian, Parapamisadaean, Sogdian, Indian, and Scythian troops. These units were usually trained and then assimilated into the army.
