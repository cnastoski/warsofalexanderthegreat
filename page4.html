      <h2 class="papertitle">The Indian Campaign</h2>
      <h4 class="paperheading">Cavalry</h4>
      <p>After The fall of the Achaemenid empire, Alexander looked forward into the Indian subcontinent. In 327 B.C Alexander mobilized his army towards the Indian sub-continent.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paperheading">Battle of the Hydaspes</h4>
      <p>In 326 B.C Alexander reached the river Jhelum (Greek Hydaspes) where 20,00 - 50,000 Indian infantry, around 100 Indian war elephants, and around 5,000 Indian cavalry units were waiting for his army led by King Porus. The battle ensued and despite the heavy infantry phalanx being outnumbered 1:5 by the Indian soldiers, they still managed to subdue the defenders due to the length of their spears, keeping the Indian soldiers at bay. After the battle the region was annexed into the kingdom and the king was still allowed to rule as a subordinate king to Alexander.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paperheading">Aftermath</h4>
      <p>After the battle of the Hydaspes and the ferocity of the defenders, the morale of the Macedonians was waning. For fear of the enemies they would have to fight eastward, and the exhaustion caused by non-stop campaigning for years, the army refused to go further. They mutinied, and Alexander was forced to stop his expansion at the Hydaspes. On the route back the conquered the surrounding clans around the Indus clans. He returned back to Susa in 324 B.C, but had lost a large portion of his army marching back from the desert.
