      <h4 class="paperheading">Background</h4>
      <p>The ancient kingdom of Macedonia existed from 808 B.C to 168 B.C. For the majority of its existence it was a lesser kingdom compared to that of Athens or Sparta, but began to flourish when Alexander the Great’s father, Philip II, came to power. Some 45 years after the Peloponnesian war, he took the reign of the kingdom of Macedonia. The kingdom was mediocre economically and pretty weak militarily. Philip spent a lot of time reforming the military and adopting the phalanx style of fighting that almost all other Greeks used. He effectively transformed a bunch of farmers and volunteers into a professional army that could stand up Macedonia’s neighbors who were crippled in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian war. After the reformation of the army, Philip sought to bring together the surrounding civilizations under Macedonian rule. Some kingdoms such as Thrace and Paeonia were subdues diplomatically while others had to be conquered militarily. Under Philip, Macedonia was brought from a relatively weak and insignificant region, to a kingdom that would rally and unify the Greeks.
      </p>
      <p>The Kingdom later was given to Alexander in the year 336 B.C after Philip II was assassinated during a marriage celebration for his daughter. He was killed by one of his seven bodyguards but the reason for his assassination is debated and not well agreed upon.  Alexander was twenty years old at the time. His father’s death caused the Macedonian Allies to falter and revolt, to which Alexander responded by taking few thousand cavalry units to consolidate the kingdom once more. This leads into his Balkan campaign. The majority of the campaign is spent securing the Macedonian borders and preparing his army to fight the Persians. After securing his borders, Alexander went above and beyond what his father ever imagined pertaining to Macedonian expansion and continued on into Persia, Egypt, modern day Afghanistan, and India, where he eventually had to turn back due to his army being on the verge of mutiny. Not too long after returning from his campaign Alexander died in Babylon. His failure to name an heir to the throne created a political vacuum within his kingdom and it was eventually split into 4 parts each controlled by one of his generals.
