      <h2 class="papertitle">The Balkan Campaign</h2>
      <p>After his acquisition of the throne in 336 B.C, Alexander had to deal with the mounting instability that was cased by the death of his father. The neighboring city states saw an opportunity to resist Macedonian Hegemony and began to revolt. Quickly, Alexander took his army and began to march.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paperheading">Illyria</h4>
      <p>Illyria encompassed what is now Albania and the surrounding area. The path from Macedonia to Illyria was strategically very important to Alexander as that path would help him take control of the other Greek city states that have revolted. The most well known battle against the Illyrians was the Siege of Pelium. The battle was between Macedonia and several Greek allies and the surrounding Illyrian tribes led by King Glaukias. At first they headed straight on but were stopped by the Illyrian forces. They regrouped and then decided that they would overtake the heights that overlooked the settlement. They won against the Illyrians without taking a single casualty and accepted their offers of fealty.
      </p>
      <h4 class="paperheading">Thebes</h4>
      <p>At first Alexander decided to handle the problem of Thebes with diplomacy, choosing to send multiple embassies that required their submission to Macedonian hegemony. However, after refusing each one, Alexander decided to take 30,000 soldiers and 3,000 cavalry and marched down to the city state. By the time his army reached Thebes, most of the Theban allies were gone, and Thebes was left by itself. Alexander did not want to destroy the city, as it would be valuable to him later on, so he stationed his army far away and hoped that its presence would scare the city into submission. This was not the case however and Thebes decided that they would still fight. They freed all of their slaves and put them into the front lines of battle. They were desperate but ultimately the Macedonian army won without taking a single casualty once again. The Thebans were forced into submission and as a punishment Alexander sold some 30,000 Thebans into slavery for revolting in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>After reigning in all of the revolting Greek city states and surrounding neighbors, Alexander was ready to push on into Asia minor. The Macedonians were preparing to face an enemy much stronger than them in population and wealth, but seriously lacked cohesion. Each satrap was basically independent and envious of the other, to which would be the main reason for the downfall of the Persian Empire.
